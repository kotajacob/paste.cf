	<h1>Welcome to paste.cf</h1>
	<p>
	This is a public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin">pastebin</a>
	server. You may upload files up to 10MB in size and have them shared
	publically. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a>
	is used to upload files to the server.
	</p>
	<p>
	The very minimal code needed for this server is open sourced under the
	3-Clause BSD License and can be found further down on this page or <a
	href="https://git.sr.ht/~kota/paste.cf">at this git repo.</a> The full
	license can be found at <a href="./LICENSE.md">paste.cf/LICENSE.md</a>
	</p>

	<h2>Why</h2>
	<p>
	I often paste things (code, text, logs, pics, gifs, etc) I want to
	share with friends, forums, or irc online, but it feels like every time
	I got used to a <a href="https://github.com/ptpb/pb/issues/246">pastebin</a>
	or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/6jbyhp/photobucket_has_changed_their_tos_to_not_allow/">imagehosting</a>
	site it went to shit within a year or two. So I figured I could spare a
	few dollars a month on a vps to host my own paste server as that's the
	only way you KNOW it will last.
	</p>
	<p>
	Turns out all the paste server software out there I could find 
	<a href="https://suckless.org/">sucked.</a> A paste server doesn't need 
	js frameworks, big dynamic servers, node, ads, fluff, a web gui, fonts, 
	complex slow clients, or any other bullshit people will invent in the 
	coming years. FTP, an HTTP server, inotify, cron, and
	2 &lt;100 line scripts is the most it should ever be.
	</p>
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<p>
	Uploading to paste.cf is quite simple. Using your favourite FTP client
	you can <code>ftp paste.cf</code>, <code>cd incoming</code> (the
	public upload directory), and <code>put file.whatever</code> then
	run <code>sha1sum</code> on your file and the public address will be
	<code>paste.cf/yoursha1.extension</code>
	</p>
	<p>
	Your pastes will be deleted eventually. Storage space costs money; if
	you need your files hosted forever read the section below and have your
	own private server running very easily.
	</p>
	<p>
	To make uploading a bit quicker I wrote a tiny client that FTPs the file
	to the server, calculates the hash, and prints what the resulting url
	should be. Basically <code>pcf notes.md</code> will return the (soon to
	be) live url. Then you can download the client <a href="./pcf.py">here</a> or scroll further
	down to read the code. Obviously you can combine <code>pcf</code> with
	other programs to do cool stuff. Like take a screenshot, upload it, and
	put the url in your clipboard. <code>scrot -q 85 scrot.png && pcf
	scrot.png | xclip -in -selection c</code>
	</p>

	<h2>How</h2>
	<p>
	This server runs an FTP server configured to allow public uploads into
	a specific directory. It also runs a simple static web server. That
	public FTP directory is watched for linux inotify updates with <a href="http://inotify.aiken.cz/?section=incron&page=about&lang=en">incrond.</a>
	Incrond is configured to run a python script (found below) when new
	files are placed in the public FTP directory. The script only does a
	few things. First it checks that the file is under 10Mb (the size can
	be specified). Then it caculates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha1sum">sha1sum</a> 
	of the file and renames + moves the file into the web server's public
	directory (wherever you specify that to be).
	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally the server uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> 
	to run another script once every hour. This script checks if the disk usage is
	above a certain percentage, if so it deletes uploaded files based on age
	That script can also be found below.
	</p>
	<p>
	With basic computer knowledge you should be able to duplicate this
	server for yourself (and even have your own private version if you'd
	like). Below are basic setup instructions as well as the aforementioned
	scripts.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Install a reasonable server operating system. My favourites are <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">alpine,</a> <a href="https://www.debian.org/">debian,</a> and <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">arch.</a> Linux 2.6.13+ will make this much easier, but with some effort this can be setup on *BSD.
		</li>
		<li>
			Install <a href="https://ftp.isc.org/isc/cron/">cron,</a> <a href="http://inotify.aiken.cz/?section=incron&page=about&lang=en">incron,</a> <a href="https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html">an ftp server</a> (or <a href="https://www.openssh.com/">sftp</a> for a private server), <a href="https://nginx.org/">a web server,</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/">python 3.</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			Optionally get a domain name to point to your server and use <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a> to get a free https cert.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Very_Secure_FTP_Daemon#Anonymous_login">Configure your ftp server to allow anonymous uploads.</a> Or use sftp and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-debian-9">setup a user plus keys</a> to make things easier for yourself. You probably wont need to do any web server configuration (other than maybe adding the ssl certs from above). You simply need to know which directory is being served. It is probably <code>/var/www/html/</code> or similar.
		<li>
			Create a user on your server to run the scripts. On debian <code>adduser --no-create-home paste</code> will do that.
		</li>
		<li>
			Make sure incrond and crond are running on your system and enabled at startup. On debian they are enabled and running if you installed them with apt, you can verify with <code>systemctl status crond</code>, figure out how the init system on your operating system works and this should be pretty simple.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add the <a href="./rename.py">rename.py</a> script to your system and make sure it's marked executable <code>chmod +x rename.py</code>. Do the same thing for remove.py.
		</li>
		<li>
			Login as your paste user, <code>su paste</code>, then edit your incron tab with <code>incrontab -e</code> so that it says something like <code>/public/ftp/directory/here/ IN_CLOSE_WRITE,IN_MOVE_TO /path/to/rename.py --file $# --hold /public/ftp/directory --web /public/web/directory --max 10</code>. Read <code>incrontab(1)</code>, <code>incrontab(5)</code>, and <code>rename.py --help</code> for more info. If you we're unable to run <code>incrontab -e</code> you probably need to add your username to <code>/etc/incron.allow</code>
		</li>
		<li>
			Now for <a href="./remove.py">remove.py</a>, edit the script so that the <code>web_dir</code> variable at the top points to the webdirectory with all the pictures. Then you can simply place the script in <code>/etc/cron.hourly/</code> if that doesn't exist on your system you'll need to also edit your cron tab to run that script once per hour.
		</li>
		<li>
			Consider donating to one or more of the open source projects you used to build your paste server, without them much of the internet would not exist.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Scripts</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="./rename.py">rename.py</a></li>
		<li><a href="./remove.py">remove.py</a></li>
		<li><a href="./pcf.py">pcf.py</a></li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Privacy and Permanency</h2>
	<p><b>
	Do not upload anything which must remain private to paste.cf as
	everything that is uploaded is public.
	</b></p>
	<p>
	Additionally anything you upload may be removed at any time so do not
	rely on paste.cf as your only copy of something important. The fact
	that things can be removed does not guarantee their removal. In fact
	virtually any uploaded file could be crawled and archived elsewhere.
	</p>
	<p>
	Finally it should be noted that the FTP server running on paste.cf is
	configured to log IPs for each uploaded file. Meaning if illegal content
	is uploaded and the authories send me a letter I'm handing them your
	IP. I'm a broke ass college student and I'm simply not interested in
	fighting your legal battles for you.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>You have been warned.</b> If you need to upload something private or
	permanent follow the instructions above and setup your own paste server.
	A server just like this one can be rented for $5 a month and give you
	and your mates plenty of bandwidth and storage.
