# Paste.cf

This is the code repository for the simple public pastebin server located at
https://paste.cf for more information about what paste.cf is or how it works
please visit the website or read the index.html file in this repo as that is
what is shown on the website.

There are two short python scripts needed to run your own paste.cf style server
and also in this repo is an experimental python client. A much more polished
and useful client is being developed at https://git.sr.ht/~kota/pcf but all you
need to use paste.cf is an ftp client and a sha1sum calculator.
